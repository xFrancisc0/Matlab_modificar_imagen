With the code "modificar_imagen.m" we can modify the photo "Foto-antigua-03.jpg"
which has a lot of visual breaks and we reconstruct this image using matlab 
coding. The file reconstructed is "imreconstruct.jpg" which can be deleted.

If "imreconstruct.jpg" is deleted, using the file "modificar_imagen.m" will
create once again the file "imreconstruct.jpg".
